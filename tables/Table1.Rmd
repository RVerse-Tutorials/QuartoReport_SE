```

```{r}
# Use format="pandoc" if you are going to Word. knitr often get confused
# if you don't and you'll drive yourself crazy wondering why the same 
# kable() command doesn't show the same table in Word (hint, its because
# unbeknownst to you, R changed the format argument value on you).
kable(dt, align="lcc", caption="Table 1. This is a basic table.", digits=c(0,1,2), format="pandoc")
